# ply_utils

This package contains a set of utilities for working with PLY files. The main
functionality is to read and write PLY files, but there are also some utilities
for working with the data in the PLY files.

Thanks to the great work [tinyply](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/tinyply/tree/master) as the foundation of this package.
